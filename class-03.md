**html provides us with three different types- ordered lists, unordered lists, definition lists**
***you can put a second list inside an <li> to create a sub list or nested list***
**unordered lists use bullets**
*boxes*
**The most popular ways to specify the size of a box are to use pixels, percentages, or ems**
**designers refer to the space between items on a page as white space**
*it is possible to hide elements using the display and visibility properties*
***Decisions and loops***
**The if  else statement checks a condition**
**Falsy values are treated as if they are false, Truthy values are treated as if they are true**
**Boolean-true or false**
**if you need to run code a specific number of times use a **for** loop**
**all values evaluate to either truthy or falsy**
